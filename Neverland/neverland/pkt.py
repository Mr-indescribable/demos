        }

    By default, the "valid" field is None. It should be set
    during the unpacking if the packet is from other node.

    The "data" field is bytes which is going to transmit or just received.

    The "fields" field is the data that hasn't been wrapped or has been parsed.
    The "byte_fields" fields is a duplicate of the "fields" field,
    the difference is data in this field is bytes type (after struct.pack).
